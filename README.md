This folder contains total 10 python scripts.
1. calculate_cluster_center.py calculates the cluster center of the ground UGVs from their current location using K-mean clustering algorithm and send these information to the UAVs.(1)
2. visualize_clustering.py creats a live visualization of the clustering scenario.(1)
3. random_walk_ugv.py implements the random walk algorithm for the Jackal UGVs within the lab environment.(2)
4. follow_square_trajectory.py implements the UGVs to follow a square trajectory.(2)
5. DroneClustering.py moves the drone to the cluster centers.(2)
6. track_ugv_and_land.py tracks the UGVs and land on top of it at the end of the mission.(2)

However, to execute the scenarios, we need the whole setup in a lab environment.
